Jared's Dotfiles
===========
For vim please see: git://github.com/jcugno/dot_vim.git

I use yadr at the moment which is what the .zsh.after directory is for
https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles.git

This WILL move your .vim settings and directory to a backup folder so it'd be
better if you installed yadr first and then vim

First, rm all of the dupe sym links you see in your local directory.
Then ln -s the .dotfiles you see. Make sure you run .brew and .osx as well

Updated the .secrets file as noted as the yadr link

Also, copy in the prompt file to ~/.zprezto/modules/prompt/functions
